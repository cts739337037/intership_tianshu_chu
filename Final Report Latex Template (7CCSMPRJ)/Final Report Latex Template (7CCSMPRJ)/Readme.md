# Disclaimer
This is an unofficial LaTeX template for KCL MSc Projects for the Informatics Department. 

It is derived from the Imperial College London Thesis template (which can be found here: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-natural-sciences/department-of-mathematics/public/study/admissions/pg/msc/math-fin/MScThesisTemplate.zip).

Unfortunately it has no Licence given, therefore I publish this under the MIT License.

Changes have been made by Sebastian Zillessen (sebastian.zillessen@kcl.ac.uk) to adapt it to KCL.

The front page has been adapted from the official front page of KCL which was ported to LaTex by Andre MÃ¼ller (andre.mueller@kcl.ac.uk). Many thanks!

Feel free to modify it or adapt it to your requirements, just make sure that you share your wisdom with everyone else by submitting a merge request.

I do not give any guarantee on this template that it fullfils the KCL regulations or any other regulations.
